# Convolutional Neural Network for Skin Cancer Classification 🧠📷

In this project, I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to solve a **skin cancer classification** problem. Specifically, this was a **multiclass classification** task where the model classifies images into four distinct categories of skin lesions. Here's a brief overview of the steps I took:

## 🗂️ Dataset Collection & Preprocessing
I gathered data for both **training** and **test** samples, specifically focused on images for **skin cancer classification**. To increase the diversity and robustness of the dataset, I applied **image augmentation** techniques. This helps the model generalize better and avoid overfitting.

## 📈 Model Performance
The CNN was trained on the collected data, achieving an **accuracy score** that exceeds **0.8** in classifying skin cancer images. This indicates strong performance in correctly identifying the different types of skin lesions.

## 🔢 Classes
This was a **multiclass classification** problem with the following categories:

- **Class 0:** Healthy
- **Class 1:** Melanoma
- **Class 2:** Basal Cell Carcinoma
- **Class 3:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma

## 🔍 Confusion Matrix
For a more detailed analysis of the model's performance, please refer to the attached screenshot of the **confusion matrix**, which shows how well the model classified the different categories of skin lesions.
